#NewsRank
===

**NewsRank is a sorting algorithm for reading the news.**

Feedly, Google Reader, Flipboard, Pulse allows you to read the latests news sorted by when articles came out. You read the newest items in an ordered list, almost like your email inbox. Imagine being subscribed to 30 or more blogs. You will end up with a cluttered feed that is filled even with things that are not important. Feed spam. We dont have time to read everything!

We used AngularJS and Rails. Working version can be found here:
