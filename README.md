#NewsRank
===

**NewsRank is a sorting algorithm for reading the news.**

Feedly, Google Reader, Flipboard, Pulse allows you to read the latests news sorted by when articles came out. You read the newest items in an ordered list, almost like your email inbox. Imagine being subscribed to 30 or more blogs. You will end up with a cluttered feed that is filled even with things that are not important. Feed spam. We dont have time to read everything!

The proposed NewsRank sorting algorithm will fix this. A new way to read your favorite blogs, articles and websites based on a calculated sorting algorithm that will show you what's important and trustworthy instead of just what's new.

For every article that NewsRank tracks, we combine information from multiple datapoints to calculate a number we call "newsrank". Multiple things affect the newsrank, such as author-credibility (how influential is the writer/author), source-credibility (how influential is the publisher/website/source), social score (how many times was the article read) and time decay (how old is the article). We will collect this data from multiple open APIs such as Bitly, Facebook, Reddit and other datapoints.
